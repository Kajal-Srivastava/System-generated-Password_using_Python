# System-generated-Password_using_Python
This mini python project is a password generator built using random library. It creates a strong &amp; secure 8-digit password simulating real life scenario. The generated password has a combination of uppercase &amp; lowercase letters, digits &amp; special characters. It creates a random &amp; unique password with each run &amp; it meets the basic security standards.

This project demonstrates core programming concepts such as string manipulation, control flow, user input handling, and the use of standard libraries. The program allows users to generate a 8 digit strong password using a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters â€” aligning with basic cybersecurity practices & real life scenario.

This project allowed me to practice essential programming concepts relevant to data analysis and data science, such as:
1.) Writing clean, modular code
2.) Handling user input and logic flow
3.) Working with strings and standard libraries

It has strengthened my problem-solving and coding skills, which are critical for scripting, data cleaning, and automation tasks.
Below skills are utilized to create this project:-
--> Knowledge of Python Programming language.
--> Knowledge and Usage of Random library in Python.
--> Handling logical flows in Python.
--> Using strings and their standard libraries.
